I created this game as a fun way to see how quickly you can guess words from scrambled letters.  On the main screen, you'll find a Start Game button to start playing and a How to Play button to read the instructions first.

 Each round allows you 60 seconds to guess the word.  If you find yourself stuck, you can use up to three hints. Simply input your answer and hit submit if you're correct, you'll earn points and move on to the next word.

 It's an easy and entertaining game to keep your mind working!

### Typography 

**[Comic Neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Chewy)**: was selected for its clean, rounded letters and friendly design. It’s easy to read, even on smaller screens, and brings a casual feel that doesn’t distract from gameplay. As a secondary font, it supports clarity and usability while keeping the visual style fun and accessible.

**[Chewy](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comic+Neue)**: was chosen as the main display font because of its bold, playful, and cartoon-like appearance. It adds a fun and energetic vibe to the game, making the interface feel more engaging and appealing. This font helps set a light-hearted tone right from the start, which matches the purpose of the game—to entertain and challenge in a relaxed way.

## Features

### Existing Features

The **Word Quest** game is designed to be fun, easy to use, and enjoyable on any device.

The look of the game stays the same throughout, with a dark teal background that makes the bright green buttons and gold highlights stand out. This helps players know where to click and what to focus on.

Everything you need to play is clearly laid out — the scrambled word, timer, score, and buttons for submitting, getting a hint, or restarting the game.

The game also works well on phones, tablets, and computers, so you can play wherever you like without anything looking messy or out of place.

### Future Features

- **Difficulty Levels**  
  Players will be able to choose between easy, medium, and hard modes to match their skill level.

- **High Score Tracking**  
  The game will keep track of top scores so players can aim to beat their personal best.
