I created this game as a fun way to see how quickly you can guess words from scrambled letters.  On the main screen, you'll find a Start Game button to start playing and a How to Play button to read the instructions first.

 Each round allows you 60 seconds to guess the word.  If you find yourself stuck, you can use up to three hints. Simply input your answer and hit submit if you're correct, you'll earn points and move on to the next word.

 It's an easy and entertaining game to keep your mind working!

**[Comic Neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Chewy)**: was selected for its clean, rounded letters and friendly design. It’s easy to read, even on smaller screens, and brings a casual feel that doesn’t distract from gameplay. As a secondary font, it supports clarity and usability while keeping the visual style fun and accessible.
